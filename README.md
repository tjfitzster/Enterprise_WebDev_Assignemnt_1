<h1>  About The Project. </h1>
<p> The purpose of this project was to create a POI application for which information is available.

Going somewhere new always starts with a search. 
Whether finding the newest restaurant in town or the nearest available electric vehicle charging station, 
The users will likely expect – and appreciate – to find the POI location data they’re looking for in the app.

POI data providers should offer easy access to reliable and detailed points of interest from trusted sources, to enable informed decision making.  </p>
